    "\n",
    "For this problem I recommend reading the lecture notes of [Introduction to Probability and Statistics (MIT Course Number\n",
    "18.05)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/index.htm), in particular chapter 12 and 13 on *Bayesian updating with discrete and continuous priors*.\n",

    "Bayes's rule says the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\cal{H} \\mid \\cal{D}) = \\frac{P(\\cal{D} \\mid \\cal{H} ) P(\\cal{H})}{P(\\cal{D})} $\n",

    "- Data (sample point): states whether a randomly chosen person from the population had suffered from a heart attack\n",

    "We have to compute the posterior. The posterior in general is computed as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that with capital $P$ we describe a probability, whereas small $p$ denotes a probability density. Thus, our posterior $p(h=f \\mid x = 1)$ is a probability density, and $p(h \\in [f+df] \\mid x = 1) df$ is the probability that our hypothesis is in the interval $[f+df]$ given the data $x = 1$.\n",

    "The likelihood $P(x = 1 \\mid h=f)$ is the probability that a person had had a heart attack according to the given model $h=f$, but we know that this is described by the probability value $f$, so we can simply write $P(x = 1 \\mid h=f) = f$\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood $P(x = 0 \\mid h=f)$ is the probability that a person has not suffered from a heart attack for a given model $h=f$, and this is described by the probability value $(1-f)$, so we can simply write $P(x = 0 \\mid h=f) = (1-f)$\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior $p(h = f)$ is uniform over $h \\in [0,1]$, so we have $p(h = f) = 1$ (constant probability density over the interval $[0,1]$. This is also known as a *flat* prior. Thus we have\n",

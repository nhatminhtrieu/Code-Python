    "If we consider a subset $H' \\subset H$, then in general the deterministic noise will increase. The reason is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $h^{*}$ be the hypothesis from a hypothesis set $H$ that best describes a target function $f$. Then deterministic noise is described as the part of  $f$ that $h^{*}$ cannot describe: $f(x) - h^{*}(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "(see lecture 11, slide 16)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words it is the inability of $h^{*}$ to describe $f$. This inability increases if we make our hypothesis set smaller by considering only a subset $H' \\subset H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let $f$ be a 10th order polynomial. Further, let $H_{10}$ and $H_{2}$ be the hypothesis sets with polynomials of order 10 and 2 respectively. Then we can find a hypothesis $h^*$ in $H_{10}$ that fits $f$ perfectly. However, if you only have  $H_2$, which is a subset of $H_{10}$, then your best hypothesis $h^*$ in $H_2$ cannot capture $f$ and has to deal with deterministic noise."

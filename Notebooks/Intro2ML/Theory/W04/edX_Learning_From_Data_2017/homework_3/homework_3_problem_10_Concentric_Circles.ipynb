    "We are given two concentric circles centered around the origin that define an area between them, a ring if you will. If a point lies in this area, it is classified as +1, else as -1. How many dichotomies can we generate with these rings? Compute the growth function $m_{\\cal{H}}(N)$ .\n",

    "We recognize that the distance of a point to the origin decides whether it lies within or outside of the shaded area that has the shape of a ring. The angle $\\alpha$ has no influence because we have rotational symmetry. If the distance is the only deciding factor, then we can reduce the problem to points on a line going from 0 to $+ \\infty$ . The ring simply becomes an interval on that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know that the growth function for the \"1-interval\" hypothesis set is ${{N+1} \\choose 2}$ +1 (see slide 12/20 of lecture 5). Since our problem is similar to the \"1-interval\" classifier, we can conclude that the growth function is\n",

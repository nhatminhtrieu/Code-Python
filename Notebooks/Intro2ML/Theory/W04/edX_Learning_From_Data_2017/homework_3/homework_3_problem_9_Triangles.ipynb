    "We first show that $N = 7$ can be shattered by the triangle hypothesis set. We choose our $N$ points to be on a circle, see also lecture slide 13/20 of lecture 5. We then argue that all $2^N$ dichotomies can be generated by considering the case where 0, 1, 2, ... 7 points lie within the triangle.\n",

    "Assuming that this configuration of $N = 9$ points on the circle can generate the most dichotomies among all 9-point configurations, i.e. there is no other set of 9 points that can generate more dichotomies, we can conclude that the triangle hypothesis set cannot shatter 9 points. (It's important to note that we did not present a rigorous proof here since we only assumed that the points on the circle is the 'best' configuration that generates the most dichotomies.)\n",

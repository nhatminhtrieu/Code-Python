    "This is a quadratic programming problem since we are trying to minimize a quadratic function that is subject to linear inequality constraints (see also eChapter 8, page 9).\n",

    "We have to determine $d$ variables from $\\mathbf{w}$ and $1$ variable from $b$, so in total we have a quadratic programming problem with $d+1$ variables."
